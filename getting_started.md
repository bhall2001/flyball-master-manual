# Getting Started
Flyball Master at the current time does not generate your schedule. Not to worry. It will soon! To get started, a rough schedule must be imported. This schedule primes the data sources for your tournament.

Details of this process are explained in the Scheduling section of this manual.

DO NOT ENTER ANY INFORMATION FOR DIVISIONS, CLUBS OR TEAMS PRIOR TO A SCHEDULE IMPORT. ALL PRIOR DATA IS ERASED WHEN A SCHEDULE IS IMPORTED TO THE SYSTEM.

Start by generating a schedule outside of Flyball Master. The schedule should only be a very rough schedule. Import this schedule into Flyball Master. Use Flyball Master's Schedule Conflict Resolution to finalize the schedule.

Now export the final schedule out of Flyball Master and LOCK the schedule in Flyball Master.

Enter Division, Club and Team data into the Flyball Master software.
