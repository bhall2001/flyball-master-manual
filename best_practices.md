#Best Practices
Our reccomendation for the most effeciant method to resolve conflicts is as follows.

1) Starting at race 1, look for Team conflicts (red dots). When a conflict is located, look at the red number in the team conflict column. This number indicates how close the Team's next race is.

2) Subtract this number from 7 (for single ring tournaments). Remember this number.

3) Double click the race with the team conflict. Assign the new race number to be the current race number minus the result from step 2.

4) Continue this process through all the races until all the red dots are gone.

NOTE: If the event has a break for lunch or is a multi-day event, having red dots around these breaks is OK. Teams that are in conflict receive the enough rest time due to the break. Smaller tournaments should plan to cluster team and club conflicts around these breaks.

5) Starting from Race one, do the same process for club conflicts. Do not attempt to resolve club conflicts until all team conflicts are resolve.
6) Look for a yellow dot in the schedule. The red number in the Club Conflict column indicates the number of races until the next club race.
7) Subtract 3 from this number.
8) Double click the race with the club conflict. Assign the new race number to be the current race number minus the result from step 7.
9) If a team conflict results, resolve this before moving on with club conflicts.

Note: A club conflict is not as critical as a team conflict to the tournament. Club conflicts may indicate that a race may delay as a club swaps dogs for the next race.

Note: Club Conflicts are OK around any planned breaks in the tournament schedule (lunch, next day).

Note: Smaller tournaments and multi-ring tournaments it may not be possible to eliminate club tournaments. 

Note: Our experience is 30% club conflicts is an acceptable number. 

Note: Tournaments seem to flow better if club conflicts are minimized at the start of the tournament and the end of a tournament. 

This allows clubs to get into the swing of things at the start of a tournament and leaves a good impression of a well flowing tournament as the event closes.
