###Race Times
Enter in the times for each race. The decimal point is optional. To enter a "No Finish", press the N key on the keyboard (interferance is scored as a No Finish). Press the tab key to move to the next field. Flyball Master will automatically calculate which team won and lost based on the times entered.

There are many circumstances where the calculated won/loss must be over-ridden. To over-ride the value, click into the field and type a W, L or T in the field.

###Dog Entry
After the a race completes, the NAFA C2 forms return from each lane to the scoring table. The C2 Form lists the dogs that raced each heat for the race. The dogs must be entered into the scoring software.

Click or tab to the left team's Heat 1 dog entry field. Enter the numbers for the dogs from the C2 form for the team. Once 4 numbers are entered, the entry automatically moves to the next heat for the team.

Frequently, the dogs for each heat are the same. To copy the dogs from the previous heat press the space bar, return or enter key.
